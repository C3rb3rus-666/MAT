GENERAL:
    - Complete the get_meta method:
	the ultimate goal is to remove
	all "harmful meta" stuff
    - Fix the ugly function get_sharedir
    - a better external app  handling
    - cleaning a file (mat-gui) in a directory where you have no write permission :
        pretends a cleaned file was created which is wrong !

TESTSUITE:
    - return code ?
    - modularity : only test format that can be processed
        on the actual config (and don't impose to have all deps
        to run the testsuite)

DOCUMENTATION:
    - need updates (mainly about pdf processing)

GUI:
    - Drag and Drop
    - Fix the statusbar

FORMATS
    - microsoft office < 2007 (ugly and insane)
    - fix zip (fix python's ziplib)
    - video's format ?
