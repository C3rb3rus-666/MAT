GENERAL:
    - Complete the get_meta method:
	the ultimate goal is to remove
	all "harmful meta" stuff
    - Fix the ugly function get_sharedir
    - Modify creation/modification date
    (except for stupid formats like zip)
    - better log management
    - cleaning a file (mat-gui) in a directory where you have no write
    permission : pretend a cleaned file was created which is wrong !

TESTSUITE:
    - return code ?

GUI:
    - display harmrful meta per file
    - drag'n'drop does not work with filenames containing spaces

FORMATS
    - microsoft office < 2007 (ugly and insane)
    - fix zip (fix python's ziplib)
    - videos format ?
